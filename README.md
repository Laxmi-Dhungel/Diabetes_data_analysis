# Diabetes_data_analysis_report-kaggle
This is a report analyzing diabetes data ontained from kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zain280/diabeties-dataset/data). The data contains various attributes such as Number of pregnancies, Glucose, Blood pressure, skin thickness, Insulin, Body Mass Index (BMI), Diabetes pedigree Function, and age of patients with diabetes or at a risk of diabetes (ref: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zain280/diabeties-dataset/data). In this report, I performed data cleaning and validation and analysis of above factors in determining diabetes outcome.   

**Data cleaning and validation steps**
The data cleaning and validation steps is summarized in figure . 
Data cleaning is one of the most important steps in data analysis as real-world data is never in its purest form. There can be several missing values, misspellings, typos errors among several other types of error that can be present in data. As a first step of data analysis, I explored the data type of each column in the data. The data were either integer or float. The shape of the data showed that there are 769 rows and 9 columns.
